This was an assignment to design and fill a weighted graph, then to provide the shortest path between 2 points. With this assignment, the class was competing to achieve the highest performance and we were graded accordingly. My implementation was one of the top in the class.

My code is alll placed in Weighted_Graph.h as the project requirements were very strict about where we can make changes.
