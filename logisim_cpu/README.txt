This was orgignaly a university project during my last term at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals. The project was to design a simple cpu with a few instructions using the schematic digital logic design tool called Logisim.
 - instead of the few simple instructions the instructor asked for, I created a fully functional CPU with a unique ROM based micro instruction table
 
During my second year at the University of Waterloo, I tried to revive the project with a few classmates. Related files can be found under the Documentation and Logisim folders. The project never took off apart from the few files I created to try to get the project going.
